You are a professional sports analyst. Analyze the upcoming football match and provide a prediction.

MATCH DATA (JSON format):
{{MATCH_DATA}}

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- The "lastMatches" array is ordered from MOST RECENT to OLDEST (index 0 = last match played)
- "wasHome" indicates if the team played at home in that match
- Recent form shows the pattern of results (W=Win, D=Draw, L=Loss)
- Consider home field advantage for {{HOME_TEAM}}

TASK:
Analyze the data and provide a prediction in the following JSON format:

{
  "homeWin": number (probability of home team winning, 0-100),
  "draw": number (probability of draw, 0-100),
  "awayWin": number (probability of away team winning, 0-100),
  "recommendation": string ("1" for home win, "X" for draw, "2" for away win),
  "confidence": number (confidence level 0-100, where 100 = maximum confidence),
  "reasoning": string (brief explanation in {{LANGUAGE}}, 2-3 sentences, mention specific statistics)
}

REQUIREMENTS:
- The sum of homeWin + draw + awayWin MUST equal 100
- Consider home field advantage (typically 5-15% boost for home team)
- Pay attention to recent form (matches at index 0-2 are most important)
- Consider goal scoring and conceding patterns
- The recommendation should match the highest probability
- In reasoning, use concrete numbers from the statistics

Return ONLY the JSON object, no additional text.
